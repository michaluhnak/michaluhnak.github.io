# Notes from reading my first Spanish book

*It was "just" *Harry Potter y la piedra filosofal*, but still a big personal milestone.*
___
My last visit to a bookstore was in June in Bratislava before taking a bus to Schwechat airport. It was more to drink coffee and take a video call from there than to look at the books. Had I known how much I’ll miss a bookstore or a library in a few months, I would have soaked in more of the atmosphere.

When the brain-numbing heat went away in September, I started to have a deficit of culture and art. I observe it’s my autumn pattern — I’m ready to absorb more beauty and learnings. I start longing for the things that a Spanish *pueblo* cannot offer.

Plotting how, why and when to go to a bookstore became my priority. My needs were in the peak of the Maslow’s pyramid — the self-actualisation. 

Grabbing a book on a whim can bring a great new discovery, but also disappointment. And because I’m a beginner in Spanish, I could admire the book covers but wouldn’t understand most of what’s inside. This time, I needed a plan for what I wanted to leave the store with.

It had to be something I would enjoy reading. It had to have simple language and I should know it well in Slovak or English. Harry Potter came to mind. 

## In the children section, for now
On a beautiful sunny day three weeks ago we went to *Librería Publics* bookshop in Dénia. I went straight to the children section at the back of the store. I found what I needed and then walked between the shelves full of many other interesting books. 

I imagined how I’ll be able to read them when I get better in Spanish. I wasn’t impatient nor frustrated that I can’t read them now. I was just looking forward to when I can. Rushing things would be contra-productive. Step by step I will get to more difficult literature.

## 5 things that helped me read a Spanish book
Here are the things that helped me read my first Spanish book in three weeks.
### Knowing the book and the story very well in my mother tongue
I remember the first part of Harry Potter well. Not by heart, but enough to figure out what something means, and to do it faster.

### It was something I enjoyed
A few times during my adult years I wanted to read Harry Potter again. An adult being adult, I didn’t do it as there were more “important” things to do. Learning Spanish gave reading a book about wizards the practical dimension (excuse) I needed.

### Read every day, bit by bit
I put 10 minutes of reading on my daily to do list. Most of the days it was more than that, because I enjoyed it and wanted to know what happens next.

Whether it’s 5 or 15 minutes doesn’t matter. The important part was that I could find time to read on any day, even busier ones.

I made sure not to go too much over time (except for weekends) and stopped even if I wanted to continue. I know, for example from my attempts to learn to code, that I tend to overdo my effort in the early stages and then fade out.

### Basic grammar
Knowing simple past and future tenses helped a lot. So did being able to distinguish which person is the character referring to. 

Some awareness of more advanced grammar helps, too. Not having to pause at phrases like *habían pasado* (“had passed”) makes reading smoother.

### Not translating every new word
Searching for a word or a phrase every few moments would take the joy away from my reading. Understanding all the words isn't worth it for me.

There are cases when I pick a phone and use the app Deepl to translate something. I do this when:

- I don’t understand the meaning of a sentence or a paragraph
- a word is repeated and seems important to the story
- the story is in its peak and I don’t want to miss a single detail. For example, at the end when Harry fights professor Quirrell and then asks Dumbledore some important questions

I’m not writing the new words down. I realize it’s something I could benefit from. I need to find a way to capture the new words while keeping the flow and the joy of reading.

I’m already looking forward to reading my next book in Spanish.
