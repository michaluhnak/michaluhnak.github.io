## The vibes at the venue

## The Valencian port and the beach
I was only in Valencia's city centre a few times before. This regatta was my first time in Marina de València, and it was beautiful. Modern but with what seemed as historic industrial buildings.
During a longer break I also managed to go for a run through Marina and to the Playa del Cabañal. I haven't seen so much life in a while. Not a party life, but runners, frisbee matches, voleyball matches, surfers...
