On March 30th the Fixed-bank rowing league season of 2024/2025 continued with a regatta in Valencia. It was organized by Club de Remo Ciudad de Valencia. Here's how I saw it.
## The vibes at the venue
I don't know if it was because I was a reserve and was able to relax more, but the atmosphere at this regatta was special. It was a wonderful spring day in the port, lively and bustling with the members of 52 (!) crews from different categories.

## The Valencian port and the beach
I was only in Valencia's city centre a few times before. This regatta was my first time in Marina de València, and it was beautiful. Modern but with what seemed as historic industrial buildings.
During a longer break I also managed to go for a run through Marina and to the Playa del Cabañal. I haven't seen so much life in a while. Not a party life, but runners, frisbee matches, voleyball matches, surfers...

## The team routines
New to the sport, I like to watch what other teams do at the races. How they handle their equipment and boats, what they wear, or how they warm-up. 

Real Club Náutico Valencia look most professional. They always warm up together as a group, in a circle. The exercise is intense and for sure one of the reasons why they almost always finish first.

Crew of Real Club Náutico Dénia cleans their boat almost in a sacred way. Everyone has hands-on the deck, literally. There was a person that did the final cleaning touch with a window squeegee. I don't know if it was their cox, but he seemed so determined he wouldn't let anyone else do the job.

## The skill and power
I was watching the time trial from a wonderful spot on Veles e Vents building. The spot was at the buoy which allowed me to watch the crews' turning techniques from up close.

There was everything - a boat missing the buoy (and penalized), some teams struggling to regain speed and rhytm, and the top teams shooting from the turn like laser-focused super robots. But they exhaled in loud harmonious symphony, a proof they were humans.
